                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a Web Developer, full stack that majors in C#, but can also use other coding methods such as Java, HTML & CSS.
                    I graduated from WeCanCodeIt bootcamp this year and have much to show for it, as you can see in my GitHub which is linked down below. I bring a lot to the table as new developer, I bring the drive to be the best at what I do and
                    the focus and commitment to get it done. Hiring a new Software Engineer to a team is a humongous deal and I understand that, that's why I never stop learning. Now let me stop blabbering and show you what I have accomplished.

                        <h3>Video Game Website</h3>
                        <p>This is my favorite project I've done so far as a Software Engineer, It was a list of video games with reviews and ratings (very similar to steam). Since steam is something I use daily, making a project extremely similar to it but with slight tweaks was amazing.</p>

                        <h3>Album Collection</h3>
                        <p>This project gives the user the option to add, delete and edit music albums and artist. This project was done as a team project consisting in a group of four people. We used a lot of pair programming equally distributing the load amongst all team members. I was mostly styling and some backend.</p>

                        <h3>Public API</h3>
                        <p>This was a API I used from openweathermap, I used fetch API, HTML, & CSS.
                        It was an incredibly fun project to work on myself and I will have more API's in my Github since I enjoyed it so much. Learning API's was an incredible lesson and it will help me in jobs further in my career.</p>
